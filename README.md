- ## Project Description

Place du Marché is an interactive website that integrates a large database of Montréal food security organizations. Our mission is to provide a user-friendly platform that not only provides exposure to the incredible community services, but to also facilitate the matching process between food organizations and volunteer candidates.
On our platform, we developped multiple features that go in this direction.
We keep on improving the service and we will continue implementing new feature in the future (recommendation model coming).
